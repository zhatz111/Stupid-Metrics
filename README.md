# Stupid-Metrics
 A project that looks at funny metrics to predict very serious things. Explores the possibility that even though you don't think two things are correlated, that doesn't mean there isn't some type of correlation to exploit! This is a fun little side project to upskill in data science. Hoping to make this into a short newsletter that people can enjoy.
